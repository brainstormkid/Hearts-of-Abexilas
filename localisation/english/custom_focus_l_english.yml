 HRP_allow_unionization_desc:0 "While in many ways somewhat antithetical to the capitalist and libertarian views of our founder, unions are an unavoidable part of modern industry. By letting them exist in one way or another, we can prevent workers from getting uppity."
 HRP_improve_ease_of_access:0 "Improve Ease of Access"
 HRP_improve_ease_of_access_desc:0 "Due to Neo Baldia being built underwater, getting into and around the area is... difficult, to say the least. By making it easier to get in and around, more tourists will show up!"

 HRP_diversify_our_industry_desc:0 "Cacti has dominated the economy of Kuára-Alasti for too long! By branching out into clay, nether wart, and armor production, we can keep our back pockets full should the price of XP crash."
 HRP_residential_subsidies:0 "Residential Subsidies"
 HRP_residential_subsidies_desc:0 "Perhaps the biggest issue in Neo Baldia is how low the population is. By offering subsidies to immigrants and the poor to move there, they will make us back the money we spend housing them, and then some!"

 HRP_multirole_fighters:0 "Multirole Fighters"
 HRP_multirole_fighters_desc:0 "As it would seem, these small highships-which our soldiers are calling Zippys due to how they zip through the sky-are quite useful for warfare. Close air support, bombing, and scouting are all easy for a Zippy. We need to make WAY more of these!"

 HRP_a_grand_navy:0 "A Grand Navy"
 HRP_a_grand_navy_desc:0 "There is no reason Harpia should not be able to smash any foe in naval combat! The strongest cruisers, the most imposing battleships, and even new Highship Carriers will give us domination on the seas."
