Who came up to check on all millitary stuff, he checked through their history and decided to sit down with them. Lighting a cigarette before starting to bring out some papers. \n\n"Gentlemen, I've came here to discuss something important with all of you. Due to all unrest and the events happening in past few weeks. We are doing a regular check up from now on."\n\nLaziOcelot immediatly interrupted Jim and said: "Wait, there can be a spy here?"\n\nJimmon responded with: "Ocelot, first of all, let me finish. Secondly no, we are not sure 100%. But we did get a tip that someone might have inflitrated our ranks. A few collaborators as we call them."\n\nPr1x said: "Suprised a spy even managed to come here knowing how many people got supressed..."\n\nShortly after, Jim started to notice how Ocelot was sweating after Pr1x mentioned that. He looked at him deep in the eyes and saw that he was trying to hide something.\n\n"Ocelot, may I ask, why are you feeling so anxious?"\n\nOcelot responded with "What are you talking about?"\n\nJim knew that there were guards outside waiting ready to take out any spy, and he took a brief second to look at Ocelot. Since he knew he had to get rid of ANY enemy spies as soon as possible he's got two choices. Either let Ocelot go, or shout for guards to arrest him."

This could also result in even worse position for us as it would show us in a really bad spotlight. Or we could try to compromise with the protestors, which could probably be the best choice after all.\n\nHowever there is one other option presented by our general staff, that is to execute the perpetrator himself. This could severely weaken the movement but it could also increase it. \n\nWhat should we do?"

In which the said city will be given to be independent country, however the two nations will maintain good relations, along with signing a Non-Aggresion Pact to preserve peace.\n\nThis treaty should now allow both nations to develop friendly relations, along with them both hopefully reaching prosperity together."

 ##Nationalism##
 election.101.t:0 "Election: Imperialist Majority"
 election.101.d:0 "This election has been devastating for the very institution it represents. The majority of the [Root.GetAdjective] population have cast their vote in favor of a imperialist party that seeks to abolish elections and install an autocratic ruler. While many consider taking up arms against this violation of the democratic ideals that allowed them this mandate to begin with, others consider the use of violence to only confirm their ideals further."
 election.101.a:0 "It is a black day for [Root.GetName], but the people have spoken."
 election.101.b:0 "We will not give up our liberty without a fight!"

 ##Socialist##
 election.103.t:0 "Election: Anarchist Majority"
 election.103.d:0 "The current election has resulted in victory for the anarchist parties, with mixed reactions from the former administration. While the new rulers claim to represent the people as a whole, they view many of the democratic institutions we cherish as attempts to manipulate and oppress the working class, leading to discussion about what truly constitutes a 'rule of the people'. In some nations, the revolution began in rivers of blood. In [Root.GetName] it didn't, but it may yet end in them."
 election.103.a:0 "This is troubling, but they truly do represent the majority."
